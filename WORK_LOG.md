| Jan 26 and Jan 27 |      12:45-2:00pm & 3:30-4:30pm       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           During class we talked about how to approach the logistical problem of counting the number of ways to represent x number of change using a b c as coins. We were thinking that we could minimize the options (u said that as a hint) so I think it would be a good idea to try to start with 1 coin and find the possible combinations with just that one coin, and then later on we add the other coins and unlock more combinations. By using dynamic programming I was thinking I can essentially break down the problem into situations for each coin, where then I set the minimum to the coin value because I think that will allow me to go from that number to the target without having errors. Additionally I think a list to store the previous possible ways to get the combinations is helpful because I need to take the previous combination number and add it to the new number when I go through my for loop. |
| Jan 30            | 9:15-10am & 3:15-4:00pm & 5:00-5:45pm | We were thinking about memoization the other class where we choose whether to include or exclude each coin, making the problem into smaller sections. I'm thinking about how to implement this recursively. I'm also thinking about using arrays.sort to sort my array so when I end up doing memoization it makes it faster so I can save more early on. Additionally, I finished thinking and implementing recursion and am thinking that to implement memoization I should check if the 2d array already has a value in the specific location that I'm looking in, so I think that will prevent me from looking up the same thing a lot, to do this I think I should check if the value in the 2d array at that index and sum is not 0 (essentially if something was put there). This work session I thought about tabulation and the key things I needed to look for when going through the 2D array's each index. So in class we were thinking and decided that we had to look up by 1, and look left by coin value because I think when we look above we are checking the number of ways we can make that value wthout the coin that we are on. I'm thinking that the looking left is because it potentially finds the ways to make the remaining amout. I wonder if sorting the list of coin values would significantly increase my runtime for recursive with memoization because if i were to sort it I could run from large to small and I think this would lead to me starting with big coins then using more memoizations if im thinking about this correct. |
