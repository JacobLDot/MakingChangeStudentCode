| Jan 26 and Jan 27 | 12:45-2:00pm & 3:30-4:30pm | During class we talked about how to approach the logistical problem of counting the number of ways to represent x number of change using a b c as coins. We were thinking that we could minimize the options (u said that as a hint) so I think it would be a good idea to try to start with 1 coin and find the possible combinations with just that one coin, and then later on we add the other coins and unlock more combinations. By using dynamic programming I was thinking I can essentially break down the problem into situations for each coin, where then I set the minimum to the coin value because I think that will allow me to go from that number to the target without having errors. Additionally I think a list to store the previous possible ways to get the combinations is helpful because I need to take the previous combination number and add it to the new number when I go through my for loop. |
